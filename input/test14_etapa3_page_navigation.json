    "description": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterized their earlier work. Its themes explore conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating mental state of founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett. Developed during live performances, an early version was premiered several months before recording began; the new material was recorded in two sessions in <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+of+the+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

    "description": "Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the British rock band Queen. The record, released on November 2, 1981, is the UK's all-time best-selling album. Combined with Greatest Hits II, it became the definitive Queen compilation. While a domestic release with different tracks but the same cover art was available in the U.S. in 1981, the British release was available to United States customers only by import until the 1995 release of Greatest Hits I & II, which combined the two discs. The seventeen-track UK Greatest Hits disc was released in the U.S. on its own for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
