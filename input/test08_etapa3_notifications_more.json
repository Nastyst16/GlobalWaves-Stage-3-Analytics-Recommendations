    "description": "Highway 61 Revisited is Bob Dylan's sixth studio album, released in 1965 by Columbia Records. It is Dylan's first album to be recorded entirely with a full rock band, after he experimented with the approach on half of Bringing It All Back Home. It is commonly tagged as documenting the \"angry young man\" period in Dylan's career, in-between the playfulness of its surrounding albums; many of the songs on Highway 61 are of an accusatory nature and feature rough, loud takes. Featuring hits and concert staples such as \"Like a Rolling Stone\", \"Desolation Row\", and \"Ballad of a Thin Man\", <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Highway+61+Revisited\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"), as his <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Bringing+It+All+Back+Home\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

    "description": "L.A. Woman is the sixth and last studio album that the American rock & roll band The Doors recorded with lead singer Jim Morrison, who died in July 1971. The album's style is arguably the most blues rock -oriented of the band's catalogue. Following the departure of their record producer Paul A. Rothchild (who dismissed the group's differing style as \"cocktail music\") around November 1970, the Doors and engineer Bruce Botnick began production on the album at The Doors Workshop in Los Angeles. Most of the tracks were recorded live, except for a few overdubbed keyboard parts by Ray Manzarek. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Doors/L.A.+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

    "description": "Synchronicity is the fifth and final studio album by The Police, released in 1983. Their most popular release together, Synchronicity includes the number one single, \"Every Breath You Take.\" The album's title was inspired by Arthur Koestler's The Roots of Coincidence, which mentions Carl Jung's theory of Synchronicity. Sting was an avid reader of Koestler, and also named Ghost in the Machine after one of his works. Synchronicity topped both the Billboard Pop Albums and Billboard 200 charts (ending the reign of Michael Jackson's Thriller for a while in the US). It won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Synchronicity\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

    "description": "Who's Next is the fifth studio album by English rock band The Who, released in August 1971. The album has origins in a rock opera conceived by Pete Townshend called Lifehouse. The ambitious, complex project did not come to fruition at the time and instead, many of the songs written for the project were compiled onto Who's Next as a collection of unrelated songs. Who's Next was a critical and commercial success when it was released, and has been certified 3\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Who/Who%27s+Next\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

Written and produced entirely by Mitchell, it was recorded in 1971 at A&M Studios in Hollywood, California. In 1979 Joni Mitchell reflected, \"The Blue album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals. At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy.

    "description": "Celebration is the third greatest hits album by Madonna, released on September 18, 2009, by Warner Bros. Records. The album features 34 songs spanning Madonna's career since signing up with the label in 1982. It also includes three new songs: \"Celebration\" which is included on all versions, \"Revolver\" which is included on the two-disc editions, and \"It's So Cool\" which is included as a bonus track on some digital two-disc editions. A fourth song, \"Broken\", was recorded for the album but not used; eventually it was released in 2012 as a limited edition promotional vinyl single for fanclub members.

    "description": "The Blueprint is the legendary sixth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released September 11, 2001 on Roc-A-Fella Records in the United States. Its release was set a week earlier than initially planned in order to combat bootlegging. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2001 at Manhattan Center Studios and Baseline Studios in New York City. Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z's previous work, The Blueprint features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West and Just Blaze. At the time of its recording, Jay-Z was awaiting two criminal trials, one for gun possession and another for <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/JAY-Z/The+Blueprint\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

    "description": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterized their earlier work. Its themes explore conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating mental state of founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett. Developed during live performances, an early version was premiered several months before recording began; the new material was recorded in two sessions in <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+of+the+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

    "description": "Synchronicity is the fifth and final studio album by The Police, released in 1983. Their most popular release together, Synchronicity includes the number one single, \"Every Breath You Take.\" The album's title was inspired by Arthur Koestler's The Roots of Coincidence, which mentions Carl Jung's theory of Synchronicity. Sting was an avid reader of Koestler, and also named Ghost in the Machine after one of his works. Synchronicity topped both the Billboard Pop Albums and Billboard 200 charts (ending the reign of Michael Jackson's Thriller for a while in the US). It won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Synchronicity\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",

    "description": "Synchronicity is the fifth and final studio album by The Police, released in 1983. Their most popular release together, Synchronicity includes the number one single, \"Every Breath You Take.\" The album's title was inspired by Arthur Koestler's The Roots of Coincidence, which mentions Carl Jung's theory of Synchronicity. Sting was an avid reader of Koestler, and also named Ghost in the Machine after one of his works. Synchronicity topped both the Billboard Pop Albums and Billboard 200 charts (ending the reign of Michael Jackson's Thriller for a while in the US). It won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/Synchronicity\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.",
